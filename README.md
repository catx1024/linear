# qbdnb

this reprository provoides a mapper prototype for smrt sequencing reads. 
the structures will be polished soon.

to use it please include the header files
and call map(genome, reads) in the pacmapper.h to return the regions
It takes StringSet\<Dna5\> as input, and return Pair<uint64_t, uint64_t> as the begin and end position in the genome 

# notice

result is supposed to output

readsid, genomeid, length(reads), length(genome) begin, end, strand, score

1.To make it easier it currently output begin and end.
please take the region: [begin, end] Â± 15% * readlength in the genome for verification.

2.revese complement strand dna is calculated during the process but the output section for them is not included yet. So please use forward strand data set for test.
